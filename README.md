# PortfolioOptimisationMatlab
This code can be use to find an optimal weighting allocation across S&amp;P500 stocks over a historical lag period. It is setup to download most recent s&amp;p500 data (this step can be commented out) and optimize historical day to yesterday's date (yesterday would be an out-of-sample date)  The Algorithm takes each stock, within the s&amp;p 500, and submits the following limit orders: 1) Bid Limit order: mean-alpha std deviations 2) Off Limit order: mean+alpha std deviations The historical performance of each bidding strategy over the past 'hist_lag' period is treated as individual strategy within a portfolio basket of strategies.  The algorithm assigns a weighting, between 0 and 1, to each individual strategy, so that the Mean-Variance criteria over the entire portfolio basket of strategies is optimized.  This code applies a unique approach to this optimization (see optimization section), using ideas from dynamic programming, to quickly compute the optimization of a large portfolio matrix  The optimal allocation, determine over the previous hist_lag period, is then applied the next day 'out of sample'.  This procedure is iteratively backtested from the 'begin_date' to the 'end_date'; the daily % return performance is computed and stored.
